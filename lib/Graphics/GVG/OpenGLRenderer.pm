=head1 NAME

  Graphics::GVG::OpenGLRenderer - Take a GVG file and turn it into Perl/OpenGL code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 circle_segments / ellipse_segments

In OpenGL, circles aren't really circles. They're polygons with a large number 
of sides, which blur together enough to look like a circle.

These attributes control how many sides those polygons will have. A circle or 
ellipse that appears larger on the screen will need to be rendered with a 
larger number of sides to maintain the illusion.

The default is 40 for both.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 make_drawer_obj

  my $opengl = $renderer->make_drawer_obj( $ast );

Given an L<Graphics::GVG::AST> object, generates a new Perl object that, when 
you call its C<draw()> method, will output the GVG description to OpenGL.

The package will be uniquely created under C<Graphics::GVG::OpenGLRenderer>.

=head2 make_code

  my $pack_code = $renderer->make_code( $ast );

Given an L<Graphics::GVG::AST> object, returns the code that can be used to 
create the same kind of Perl object made by C<make_drawer_obj()>.
